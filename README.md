## 📝 Key Principles

1. **Planning** — agents ask questions before implementation
2. **Audit** — search for existing solutions before creating new ones
3. **No placeholders** — full implementation or explicit request to defer
4. **Minimal changes** — precise fixes without over-engineering
5. **Context7** — up-to-date documentation via MCP
