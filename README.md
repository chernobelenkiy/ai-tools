## Commands

Slash commands in `commands/` orchestrate multi-agent workflows:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/implement-feature` | Standard workflow: Plan → Implement → Test → Refactor → Verify |
| `/implement-tdd-feature` | TDD workflow: Tests first → Implement → Refactor → Verify |
| `/implement-bdd-feature` | BDD workflow: Gherkin scenarios → Tests → Implement → Verify |
| `/test-code` | Analyze code, write automated tests (Playwright/Jest/Vitest) |
| `/refactor-code` | Simplify and improve code readability and scalability |
| `/prd-creation` | Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document |
| `/team-review` | Multi-agent review (Architect, UX, Sales, PM, Refactorer) |
| `/design-review` | UX/UI audit: Audit → Critique → Optimize → Verify |
| `/design-system` | Build a design system: Tokens → Components → Patterns → Docs |
| `/business-review` | Product-marketing audit using 5C/SWOT framework |
| `/research` | Comprehensive research: Context -> Search -> Brainstorm -> Propose |

## Environment Variables

```bash
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Principles

1. **Plan First** — Always ask clarifying questions before coding
2. **Audit & Reuse** — Search for existing patterns before creating new ones
3. **No Placeholders** — Full implementation only, no TODOs or FIXMEs
4. **Context7** — Always use for up-to-date library documentation
5. **Verify** — Never mark done without build verification
