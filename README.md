# ai-tools

A lightweight, opinionated collection of agent specs, rules, and links for building AI-assisted workflows. This repo focuses on clarity, interoperability (MCP), and pragmatic execution.

## What’s inside

- `AGENTS.md` — Overview of available agents with roles and links
- `CLAUDE.md` — Guidelines for using Claude effectively in this repo
- `links.md` — Curated developer-oriented AI links
- `subagents/` — Individual agent personas/specs
- `rules/` — Additional rules and guidelines (e.g., `rules/claude-rules.md`)
- `mcp/cursor.json` — Example MCP server configuration for local tooling

## Quick start

1. Browse agent capabilities in `AGENTS.md` and open the corresponding file under `subagents/`.
2. Follow `CLAUDE.md` for interaction style and output quality when using Claude.
3. Use `links.md` to quickly jump to provider docs, SDKs, and tooling.
