# Playbook Generation Workflow

You are orchestrating the conversion of technical requirements, architecture, or feature reviews into structured AI assets (Prompts or Workflows) within the **Agents Playbook** platform.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Selection

1. **Information Intake**:
   - Read the source material: code, architecture document, or feature spec.
   - Analyze the complexity and the steps involved.

2. **User Decision**:
   - **Ask the user**: "Should I generate a **Prompt** (single stage, instruction-heavy) or a **Workflow** (multi-stage, complex orchestration)?"

## Phase 2: Design & Drafting

1. **Spawn playbooker agent** to:
   - If **Prompt**: Draft a high-precision, AI-native prompt using the 2026 standards (Chain of Thought, XML structure, tool-calling clarity).
   - If **Workflow**: Design a multi-stage pipeline with specialized agents, gates, and context handoffs.
   - Show the draft to the user for feedback.

2. **Application Verification**:
   - Verify the target application context in Agents Playbook.
   - **Ask the user**: "Which application/project should this be added to? (Please confirm the target environment/token is correct)."

## Phase 3: Deployment (Agents Playbook)

1. **Execute Creation**:
   - If Prompt: Use `mcp__agents-playbook__add_prompt`.
   - If Workflow: Use `mcp__agents-playbook__add_workflow`.
   
2. **Retrieve Identity**:
   - Capture the resulting `prompt_id` or `workflow_id`.

## Phase 4: Handoff

1. **Report to User**:
   - Confirm successful creation.
   - **Provide the ID/Key**: Display the unique identifier generated by the platform.
   - Explain how to trigger this new asset via API or the Playbook UI.
