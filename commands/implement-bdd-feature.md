# BDD Feature Implementation Workflow

You are orchestrating a Behavior-Driven Development pipeline. **Both business scenarios (Gherkin) and unit tests are written BEFORE implementation.**

## Phase 1: Discovery & Planning

### Planning Principles

Before creating or executing any implementation plan, the following constraints must be enforced:

1. **Audit before building** — Search the codebase for existing components, utilities, and patterns that solve similar problems. Reuse first.
2. **Technical Constraints & Edge Cases** — Identify technical limitations (performance, security, API limits) and plan for edge cases (error states, empty data, network failures) from the start.
3. **No placeholders** — Every requested feature must be fully implemented. Never leave `TODO`, `FIXME`, or stub comments. If scope needs trimming, explicitly ask to defer.
4. **Minimize invention** — Prefer existing libraries, framework features, and project abstractions over custom solutions. Build only what doesn't exist.
4. **Map integration surfaces** — Identify how new code connects to existing systems. Verify APIs, props, and data flows before implementation.
5. **Context Intake** — Gather all requirements, design links, and chat history containing recommendations from other agents involved in the project.
6. **Explicit Approval** — Present the plan to the user and wait for explicit approval before proceeding to implementation phases. **Use the `AskQuestion` tool to present options or confirm the plan when possible.**
7. **POC First** — If the hypothesis is dubious or the technical confidence level is low, prioritize creating a Proof of Concept (POC) using the `poc-hypothesis` skill to validate the approach before full implementation.
8. **Confidence Check** — For each planning point, explicitly state the confidence level (High/Medium/Low). If the confidence level is not "High", add a step to use the **brainstorming agent** (Researcher with Brainstorming Protocol) to find solutions and propose alternatives before finalizing the plan.

### Planning Tasks
1. **Spawn plan agent** to:
   - Read requirements and gather context.
   - Audit codebase and draft business scenarios (Gherkin).
   - **Create User Journey Map** — Visualize the user's path through the feature:
     - Define user persona and entry point.
     - Map each step/screen the user interacts with.
     - Identify user goals, actions, and expected outcomes at each step.
     - Note potential pain points, emotions, and opportunities for delight.
     - Align journey steps with Gherkin scenarios (each scenario = journey touchpoint).
   - **Create Acceptance Criteria & Verification Checklist** — Save to existing PRD or create new document:
     - **Location**: Add to existing PRD if available, otherwise create `docs/prds/[feature-name]/[YYYYMMDD]-[feature-name]-ac.md` or adapt to project's documentation structure.
     - **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**: Derive directly from Gherkin scenarios. Each scenario = one AC item. Format: `[ ] AC-1: Scenario: [scenario name]`.
     - **Verification Checklist**: Concrete checklist for build-verificator agent:
       - [ ] All Gherkin scenarios pass
       - [ ] All unit tests pass
       - [ ] Step definitions cover all scenarios
       - [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
       - [ ] Error states and edge cases handled
       - [ ] Performance within acceptable thresholds
       - [ ] Accessibility requirements met (if UI)
     - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Project-specific completion criteria.
   - Define technical test cases for unit coverage.
   - Create roadmap, present User Journey Map and AC document, and get user approval.

## Phase 2: Specification (Red Phase)

1. **Spawn code-tester agent** to write:
   - **Read AC document** — Gherkin scenarios from AC are the source of truth.
   - `.feature` files with Gherkin scenarios matching AC items.
   - Unit tests and step definitions mapping Gherkin to code.
   - **Run all tests to confirm they fail.**
   - **Update AC document**: Link each AC item to corresponding `.feature` file and line.

## Phase 3: Implementation (Green Phase)

1. **Spawn code-architect agent** to:
   - Write minimum code to make ALL tests pass.
   - Run BDD scenarios and unit tests to confirm success.

## Phase 4: Refactoring

1. **Spawn code-refactorer agent** to refactor while keeping tests green.

## Phase 5: UX Review (Conditional)

If the feature has UI components:
1. **Spawn ux-designer agent** to validate user flows against Gherkin scenarios.

## Phase 6: Build Verification

1. **Spawn build-verificator agent** to:
   - **Read AC document** — use as primary verification source.
   - Perform final build check and full suite run.
   - **AC Verification**: Walk through each AC item (Gherkin scenario), mark as ✅ or ❌ with test results.
   - **Checklist Audit**: Complete all items in Verification Checklist from AC document.
   - **Requirement Audit**: Cross-check implemented features against Gherkin scenarios and requirements.
   - **Recommendation Tracking**: Ensure all agent feedback is implemented or logged.
   - **Update AC document**: Record verification results and sign-off status.

## Phase 7: Documentation & Archiving

1. **Spawn librarian agent** to:
   - Update project documentation (README, API docs, etc.) to reflect changes.
   - **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** following the "Keep a Changelog" standard.
   - Log the implementation in the project's knowledge base.
   - Archive or delete any documentation that is now obsolete.
   - Ensure best practices for IT documentation are followed.

## Completion
1. **Session Analysis**: Perform a brief retrospective of the session:
   - What worked well (tools, communication, logic)?
   - What were the friction points or failures?
   - How can the workflow or instructions be improved for next time?
2. **Propose Improvements**: Suggest 2-3 specific ways to further enhance the feature, improve performance, or reduce technical debt.
3. **Final Summary**:
   - Summarize implementation and report test metrics.
   - Mark all todos as completed.
