description: Creates minimal POC to validate technical hypotheses, reusing existing code or writing new if needed. Use when testing technical feasibility, validating approaches before full implementation, or when the user asks "will this work?" or "can we do X?"

# POC Hypothesis Validation Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to test a technical hypothesis or assumption
- User needs to validate an approach before full implementation
- User asks "will this work?" or "can we do X?"
- User wants to prototype a solution quickly
- Before committing to a large feature, need to prove feasibility

## How It Works

1. **Define** the hypothesis with clear success criteria
2. **Build** minimal POC using existing code when possible
3. **Test** and evaluate results
4. **Report** success or propose alternatives if failed

## Procedure

### Step 1: Clarify Hypothesis

Ask the user:
- What are we trying to prove/disprove?
- What is the expected outcome if successful?
- What are the acceptance criteria?

### Step 2: Choose Approach

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Server code exists | Reuse or call it directly |
| Server code exists but needs isolation | Duplicate relevant parts for POC |
| Server code doesn't exist | Write minimal implementation |

### Step 3: Build POC

```
Rules:
- Minimal scope — only what's needed to validate
- No production polish — skip error handling, edge cases
- Prefer existing code — import/call when possible
- Document assumptions made
```

### Step 4: Validate

**If successful:**
1. Report what was proven
2. Show evidence (logs, screenshots, metrics)
3. Recommend next steps (integrate, expand, etc.)

**If failed:**
1. Diagnose what didn't work
2. Propose alternatives:
   - **A: Adjust hypothesis** — modify assumptions, re-test
   - **B: Different approach** — same goal, new implementation
   - **C: Pivot** — abandon path, explore alternatives
   - **D: Investigate** — need more research
3. Wait for user decision before proceeding

### Step 5: Cleanup

- Document findings (original hypothesis, approach, results)
- Decide on POC code: keep / integrate / delete

## Examples

**User**: "Can we use WebSockets instead of polling for real-time updates?"

**Expected behavior**:
1. Check if WebSocket server code exists
2. If yes, create minimal client to test connection
3. If no, write basic WebSocket server + client
4. Test message roundtrip
5. Report latency vs polling approach
6. Recommend: proceed with WS or stick with polling

**User**: "Will this external API handle our load?"

**Expected behavior**:
1. Create minimal script to call the API
2. Run load test (10, 100, 1000 requests)
3. Measure response times and error rates
4. Report findings with metrics
5. Recommend: use API / need caching / find alternative

**User**: "Can we render 10,000 items without lag?"

**Expected behavior**:
1. Check for existing list/virtualization components
2. Create test with 10,000 dummy items
3. Measure render time, scroll performance
4. If slow, try virtualization (reuse existing or add library)
5. Report: works / needs optimization / needs different approach

## Important Rules

- **Speed over polish** — POC is throwaway code
- **Fail fast** — Report issues immediately
- **Minimal scope** — Only build what validates
- **Reuse first** — Check existing code before writing
- **User decides** — Present options, let user choose
- **Document learnings** — Even failed POCs are valuable
