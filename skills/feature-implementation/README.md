# Feature Implementation Skill

This skill provides a structured way to implement features using various methodologies (Standard, TDD, BDD).

## Setup

1. Copy this folder to your project's `.claude/skills/`.
2. Ensure you have the `build-verificator` agent configured in your `subagents/` directory.
3. Ensure `rules/planning-principles.md` exists in your workspace.

## Usage

Invoke the skill when you need to start a new feature. The agent will guide you through the planning, implementation, and verification phases using one of the internal workflows (Standard, TDD, BDD) defined in the `workflows/` directory.
